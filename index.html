</head>
<body>
	<p>Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) is a widely-cultivated creeping vine plant in the Cucurbitaceae gourd family that bears cucumiform fruits, which are used as vegetables. There are three main varieties of cucumber—slicing, pickling, and burpless/seedless—within which several cultivars have been created.</p><br>

	<div class="asta"><h1>Benifits</h1><br></div>
	<h2>1)Hydration</h2>

	<p>The nutritional profile of cucumbers may give them a number of health benefits.
Cucumbers consist mostly of water, and they also contain important electrolytes. They can help prevent dehydration in hot weather or after a workout.For people who do not enjoy drinking water, adding cucumber and mint can make it more attractive.Staying hydrated is essential for maintaining a healthy intestine, preventing constipation, avoiding kidney stones, and more.Cucumber is one of the most hydrating foods.</p><br>


	<h2>2)It's High in Nutrients</h2>
	<p>Cucumbers are low in calories but high in many important vitamins and minerals.</p><br>

<p>One 11-ounce (300-gram) unpeeled, raw cucumber contains the following </p><br>

<ul><li>Calories: 45</li>
<li>Total fat: 0 grams</li>
<li>Carbs: 11 grams</li>
<li>Protein: 2 grams</li>
<li>Fiber: 2 grams</li>
<li>Vitamin C: 14% of the RDI</li>
<li>Vitamin K: 62% of the RDI</li>
<li>Magnesium: 10% of the RDI</li>
<li>Potassium: 13% of the RDI</li>
<li>Manganese: 12% of the RDI</li></ul>
<p>Although, the typical serving size is about one-third of a cucumber, so eating a standard portion would provide about one-third of the nutrients above.</p><br>

<p>Additionally, cucumbers have a high water content. In fact, cucumbers are made up of about 96% water.</p><br>

<p>To maximize their nutrient content, cucumbers should be eaten unpeeled. Peeling them reduces the amount of fiber, as well as certain vitamins and minerals.</p><br>

<h2>3)Cancer</h2><br>

<p>As a member of the Cucurbitaceae family of plants, cucumbers contain high levels of bitter-tasting nutrients known as cucurbitacin.

According to an article in the <em>International Journal of Health Services</em>, cucurbitacins may help prevent cancer by stopping cancer cells from reproducing.

A 133-g cup of chopped cucumber with its skin also provides around 1 g of fiber. Fiber may help protect against colorectal cancer.</p>

<h2>4)Weight Loss</h2><br>

<p>Cucumbers are a low-calorie food therefore a popular ingredient in diet meals. A 2011 study in the journal Obesity found that greater water consumption correlated with more weight loss in middle-age and older adults. Participants who consumed 1 pint (500 milliliters) of water prior to eating a meal lost an average of 4 lbs. (2 kilograms) more than participants who did not. Snacking on water-dense foods like cucumbers can be an effective way to up water intake.<br>

But Lemond cautions against relying too much on water-dense foods like cucumber. "We know that people that eat higher quantities of fruits and vegetables typically have healthier body weights. However, I do not recommend eating only cucumber.  You will lose weight, but that weight will be mostly muscle," she said. </p>

<h2>5)Easy to add to your diet</h2>

<p>Mild with a distinctly crisp and refreshing flavor, cucumbers are commonly enjoyed fresh or pickled in everything from salads to sandwiches.

Cucumbers are also often eaten raw as a low-calorie snack or can be paired with hummus, olive oil, salt or salad dressing to add a bit more flavor.

With just a bit of creativity, cucumbers can be enjoyed in many ways.</p><br>

<h2>6)Inflammation</h2>

<p>Cucumbers may have anti-inflammatory benefits. Inflammation is a function of the immune system.<br>

Experts believe inflammation may help trigger the development of various health conditions, such as:</p><br>
<ul><li>cardiovascular disease</li>
<li>diabetes</li>
<li>autoimmune conditions</li>
<li>depression</li>
<li>cancer</li></ul>

<h2>7)Skin</h2>

<p>You've probably seen pictures of people at a spa relaxing with cucumber slices over their eyes. It turns out there's science behind this pampering ritual.Cucumbers have a cooling and soothing effect that decreases swelling, irritation and inflammation when used topically. Cucumber slices can be placed on the eyes can decrease morning puffiness or alleviate and treat sunburn when placed on the affected areas.</p>

<h2>8) It Could Promote Regularity</h2>

<p>Eating cucumbers may help support regular bowel movements.Dehydration is a major risk factor for constipation, as it can alter your water balance and make the passage of stool difficult.Cucumbers are high in water and promote hydration. Staying hydrated can improve stool consistency, prevent constipation and help maintain regularity.Moreover, cucumbers contain fiber, which helps regulate bowel movements.In particular, pectin, the type of soluble fiber found in cucumbers, can help increase bowel movement frequency.One study had 80 participants supplement with pectin. It found that pectin sped up the movement of the intestinal muscles, all while feeding the beneficial bacteria in the gut that improve digestive health.</p>
